# book-storing-system
A simple book storing system which can be useful for a library or small book shop

*My project is about creating a small program that can add, remove and search in a book store. Main purpose of doing this project I like to work in the field of database and programming both. So, I thought if I do somthing like this I can practice myself from basic. For my point of view, it will take some time as well as with my thesis topic, I don't have much time to do something outstanding. But if I got time I will prepare that librarian can add members and book issue details too. But I don not think I will have have that much time to do everything. I will try my best in developing the project.

1. Java ( Netbeans to develop the program )
2. SQL developer ( To store data about books)

I will use following internet sources for developing my system

1. https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart-gui.html - Developing system
2. https://docs.oracle.com/netbeans/nb81/netbeans/develop/work_dbases.htm#NBDAG1790 - Stroing the data and connecting the database
