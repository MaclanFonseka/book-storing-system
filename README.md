# book-storing-system
A simple book storing system which can be useful for a library or small book shop

..*My project is about creating a small program that can add, remove and search in a book store. Main purpose of doing this project I like to work in the field of database and programming both. So, I thought if I do somthing like this I can practice myself from basic. For my point of view, it will take some time as well as with my thesis topic, I don't have much time to do something outstanding. But if I got time I will prepare that librarian can add members and book issue details too. But I don not think I will have have that much time to do everything. I will try my best in developing the project.
